#### Audacity <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">&#128279;</a>

Audacity is one of the best tools for editing audio files. It has a large assortment of features to do pretty much anything. It is also very easy to learn. This is a great replacement for tools like Reaper. While this app is open source, one of the latest updates did add telemetry. You can block it with a firewall setting or you can install a fork of the original project (Tenacity).

#### Gimp <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.gimp.org/">&#128279;</a>

Gimp is a replacement for Adobe Photoshop. It allows you to do all of the same things in Photoshop, but you can do much more. More importantly, it is free and open source. It can run on nearly any hardware but it does have a high learning curve. Similar to Adobe, you need to put in some time to learn the software if you want to use it efficiently.

#### Lainon AI <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://laion.ai/">&#128279;</a>

This is a project which aims to make a self hostable ChatGPT model and virtual assistant. Unlike ChatGPT, it will attempt to fetch data and parse it in real time. This allows for a Siri/Google Assistant/Cortana that is actually private. The code is already open source and the model will soon be as well. At the moment, it is in alpha.

#### Mastadon <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://joinmastodon.org/">&#128279;</a>

Mastadon is an open source replacement for many social media platforms. While it does have many of the same features, it works differently than most platforms. Unlike Twitter, Mastadon is a federated network. This offers unique control over the content that you want to see. Users can choose a homeserver or create their own. The homeserver defines the rules for your account and determines which users you can talk to. For example, if you are interested in gaming you can limit yourself to only seeing gaming homeservers.

Mastadon does not have any ads or trackers. This is because each homeserver is responsible for its own expenses. Many are funded by the community.

Its functionality can be compared to email. You must choose a service(Gmail, Outlook, Protonmail) and follow its terms of service. You can talk to other users on the same service and you can communicate with other services. Mastadon works the same way.

#### Matrix <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://matrix.org/">&#128279;</a>

Matrix is a decentralized chat platform. It is very similar to Discord in many aspects. Matrix supports end to end encryption, automatic deletion of messages, and many other privacy features. Matrix can be access by a number of free clients. Since the API is completely open, you can read matrix messages from anywhere (phone, pc, even the command line!). You can run your own instance of Matrix or you can use an existing server. Using the bridge feature, you can link Matrix to other platforms such as IRC, Discord, and Telegram. While the primacy goal of Matrix is text communication, you can also do voice and video communication over WebRTC.

#### NewPipe <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://newpipe.net/">&#128279;</a>

NewPipe is an Android app to access videos and streams on Youtube. It has no ads and no tracking software. It offers the full functionality that the real app has. Additionally, several features (such as video downloads) are available without a Youtube Red subscription. Due to these features, it is not on the Google Play store and must be downloaded via their [Github Page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases) or on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/).

#### Glimesh <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://glimesh.tv">&#128279;</a>

Glimesh is an open source alternative to streaming apps like Twitch, Youtube, and Trovo. It is community funded and can be ran on your own server (for private streaming). Alternatively, you can access the public version at [Glimesh.tv](https://glimesh.tv).

While it is rather small compared to other services, it does have many of the same features.

#### OBS <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://obsproject.com/">&#128279;</a>

OBS (Open Broadcast Studio) is a free application to record and stream video. It supports nearly any kind of input and output. It is commonly used by livestreamers and content creators but it can be used to quickly record a video for private use as well. You can select which windows (called sources) you want to be seen by the output. Many filters and other tools exist to customize the output. Using scenes, you can run a full production level TV series.

#### ProtonMail <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://proton.me/mail">&#128279;</a>

ProtonMail is a privacy centered email service. They offer E2E (end to end) encryption for all emails. This prevents them from being read by anyone aside from the recipient. Protonmail has no ads and no trackers. It has a basic free tier, but for serious use you will want to use a paid tier. What makes this service unique is how its encryption works. Other services also offer encryption. However, they store the keys needed to decrypt *your* emails on **their** server. This means that the service can read them (and sell them for ads) and the government can legally request access to all of your emails. Protonmail does not do this. Only the user has the key. This means that even if the government requests a warrant, they cannot read your files.

Like other email services, Protonmail offers calendar, storage, and a VPN service.

#### Signal <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.signal.org/">&#128279;</a>

Signal offers free, highly encrypted messaging. You can set individual controls for each message. You can have messages delete themselves after a certain amount of time has passed. It is one of the best services for wireless communication. For many people, this can replace SMS messaging and other messaging services over the internet such as What's App, Facebook Messenger, and others. Signal also supports video and voice chat for alternative communication.

#### Thunderbird <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/">&#128279;</a>

Thunderbird is an open source app to view emails from any device. It is **not** an email service. Instead, it uses mail protocols to access your emails from any location. It has integrations with many of the existing email providers such as Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and more. It can also connect to RSS feeds to provide a custom new service. This is a very handy feature.

#### VSCodium <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://vscodium.com/">&#128279;</a>

This is an open source version of Visual Studio Code. VSC is open source. However, the version that Microsoft releases is not open source. They add several tracking and telemetry aspects. This fork simply provides a build of the original code without any privacy invasive elements. It is free, and has all the same features. It also allows you to use alternative extension stores. You can install extensions from any source. It does have less extensions than the normal marketplace, but they respect your privacy. If you can't find the extension you need, you can use a config hack to access the original store.
