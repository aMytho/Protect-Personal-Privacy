### Biometric Privacy Act

- $650 million

Facebook used Biometric identification software to "tag" users in photos and to aid in facial recognition. This allowed them to identify an extremely large amount of the population. Roughly a third of the entirety of Facebook was affected. Additionally, Facebook was able to tag people in photos even if they do not have a Facebook account.

### Sharing of Private Messages and Contacts

- Unknown amount

Facebook shared user content to Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Netflix, and over 150 others. The content included users' message content and private posts.

### Location Data

- Unknown amount

Facebook ignores privacy switches and tracks location regardless of any settings. Facebook will attempt to determine your location from check-in services, profile data, physical location (traveling near a business that has facebook ads), WiFi, and Bluetooth services.

### "Free" Service

- $4 million

Facebook was fined 4 million because they are not a "free" app, despite being labeled as one. The Hungarian Competition Authority determined that Facebook is not a free service because the users' personal information is used for specialized advertising.

### Conversation Eavesdropping

Facebook used private voice data from the Messenger app. While they claimed to not use it to identify or advertise to users, we have no way to verify this. Many people have noticed that if you have a conversation about a product, you receive an add for it soon after. They deny this every time. Before you believe them, research how many times Mark Zuckerberg has apologized. They have lied <em>many</em> times in the past.
