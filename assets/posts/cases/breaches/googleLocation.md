# Google Location Data Lawsuit

Google agrees to pay a fine of $400 million after a privacy lawsuit. Google is able to track your location from a large amount of factors. Between websites, browser, devices, and internet services (primarily Google) has access to a lot of your location history. While they claim to respect your privacy, this is not the case.

## Preventing Location Tracking

Many people turn off location tracking in an app or service and believe that that is all they have to do to remain safe. However, Google has been very sneaky with their approach to location tracking. There are many switches you must toggle to "fully" disable it. However, even if you turn off every location switch, some tracking is built into the OS and cannot be disabled. To disable location tracking, you need to take the following steps:

(These steps vary by device/service)
- Disable tracking at the app level. Some apps have their own settings panel with their own individual settings. Consider all apps! For example, some photo apps automatically add location metadata to photos.
- Disable Google account-wide tracking at [My Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/). Disable location history and any other unwanted features.
- Disable device tracking. This varies by device. However, all OS's allow you to disable location tracking for individual apps or turn it off altogether. Look for terms like "location accuracy" and "improve location services". The best practice is to disable location until the app asks for it again.

> Although you can disable some tracking, part of it is built into the OS and cannot be removed. However, less tracking is always better than more tracking!

Disabling location access varies by phone model and provider.
