# Linkedln Breach

In June 2021, Linkdeln had the data for over 700 million users mined in a massive webscraping attack. 

## Understanding the Breach

This was not a "hack" in a traditional sense. Webscraping is when a script scans the website for publicly available information. Using this technology and the API, millions of users data were accessed. While this is a problem, it is not illegal (although it probably violates their TOS). In fact, you could do this yourself with the right script!

The data contained phone numbers, emails, and other identifying information. Since Linkedln is a networking platform, many users posted fully accurate information with many ways to be contacted. This information could be used for a variety of phishing and impersonation attacks.

## Preventing Similar Issues

While you can't control what is accessible via a service's API, always consider what info a service has on you. Frequently, the website makes much of the profile and contact information freely available to anyone with a computer and basic programming skills. Consider falsifying information (platform dependent), omitting sensitive details, and reducing the amount of services used.
