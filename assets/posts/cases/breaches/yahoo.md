# Yahoo Breach

In 2013, Yahoo was breached by a hacking group. They managed to steal information from over 3 billion accounts. While the information accessed wasn't overly sensitive, the problem was how long Yahoo took to reveal the breach to their users. Yahoo publicly announced the breach over **3 years later**.

## Was it Preventable?

Since we don't know any specific details, it is difficult to know if it was preventable. However, we as users need to carefully examine the services that we use. We should always choose a service with a reputable privacy and security rating.

Every service is hacked eventually. They should always notify users as soon as the breach has been analyzed. If a potential service has been hacked, consider how they reacted to the breach. If they were transparent and made strong efforts to prevent similar hacks from happening, they may be a good service.
