## Communication

Our communicaion is one of the most important things to protect. Our communication is a window into how we feel and think. Companies know this and try to access it using many different means.

### SMS (Text Messaging)

SMS text messaging is not secure. SMS has no encryption. This means that it is vulnerable to several forms of interception. The most common one is via the carrier. Your mobile phone service provider can read all of your messages at any time. Your messages have to pass through their servers. Frequently, they store them long term. AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile have been caught selling user location data. Others have been caught selling the content itself.

Another vulnerability is interception via stingray. While these are not used on average citiziers, they are a threat. A stingray can pretend to be a cellphone tower and receive all message content. Since the message is not encrypted, a stingray can read all message content. However, the government does not need to use a stingray to monitor your messages. Under the patriot act, your messages are already being scanned for certain keywords. Additionally, most companies hand over user data to the governemtn with or without a warrant.

#### Signal

One option to escape these issues is to use signal. It is an encrypted messaging platform with a high focus on security and encryption. It is free and is a far better option. Similarly to SMS, you can send messages and particapte in group chats.

### Email

Email is another target. Since email is (usually) a free service, it suffers from the most surveilance. Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and nearly every other provider sell the content of your emails. Nothing you send in an email is private. Email is also a target for government surveilance efforts. Many services require email verification not for security, but for identification purposes. 

While encryption can help, it is not a full solution. Gmail offers encryption services. However, gmail always stores the security keys. This means that your emails may be protected from network level attacks, they can still see the content of your emails. It is also vulnerable to government requests for information. 

### Proton Mail / Self Hosted Mail

Proton mail is a great email service. They have some of the strongest encryption services. While there is a free tier, many users will need to pay for a premium tier to get the intended service. Unlike Gmail, Proton Mail does not store your encryption keys. This means that even if the government requests your information, your email content is safe. This also protects you from ads and other information gathering.
