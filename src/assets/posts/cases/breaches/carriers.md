# Mobile Carrier Selling Location Data

The major carriers in the U.S. sold customer location data to various third parties. Since your phone is constantly communicating with cellular towers, your location can also be transmitted. Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T were collectively fined over 200 million dollars for these breaches of privacy.

## Prevention

Unfortunately, there is little an individual can do to protect their location from carriers. Due to how the technology works, a connection with the tower is required to be able to make/receive phone calls. However, you can turn on airplane mode, eject the SIM, or turn off the phone when you know you won't need it. Just remember to turn it back on when you are ready!

One alternative is to invest in other means of communication. Using secure messaging apps like [signal](https://www.signal.org/) are a great replacement for SMS. You can use other services such as email or matrix for long form communications.
