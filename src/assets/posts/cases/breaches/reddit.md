# Reddit Breach

The social media platform Reddit received a data breach in early Febuary of 2023. A hacker was able to access the source code and some internal systems of Reddit. Additionally, they were able to get access to limited employee information. While the user data is safe, the unintended release of the source code will make it easier for attackers to gain access to user data in the future.

## What Happened

A Reddit employee was sent an email to the Reddit page. This was a phishing link. The website was not really reddit, but a fake site set up by the attacker! Believing it was safe, the user entered their password and 2FA code and gave the attacker access to internal systems. The user believed they may have made a mistake, and reported it soon after.

## Was it Preventable?

Yes, this was preventable. You should always check that a link matches the intended destination. Be on alert for mistakes in grammar, spelling, and UI quirks.

As users of Reddit, we can't do anything about this breach. However, we can choose strong passwords, add 2FA, and use browser extensions to protect our information.
