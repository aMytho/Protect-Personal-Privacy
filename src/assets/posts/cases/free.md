# Free Services

A vast majority of the internet is offered for free. As long as you have an internet connection and a device, you can access nearly anything! While is is a good thing, many people don't consider why this is the case. The most obvious reason is ads. Most people come to this conclusion. However, there is far more to it. Running an ad is not enough to keep a website running. Another source of revenue is personal information. Since most sites run ads, this is a viable next step.

## Your Data is Worth More Than You

### User Identification

A growing amount of users are aware that services sell your personal information. However, few users realize how much information a website can access. Some of the information can be accessed directly via the browser. Each broswer provides a set amount of information to every website that asks for it. While some is protected behind a permission, others are not.

Websites also use third party cookies. These can track you across the web and are not limited to a single site. Most businesses rely on Meta(Facebook) or Google ad services. Because these are so widespread, Meta/Google is aware of each separate website you visit. While an individual website may not initally know the last website you were on, the ad sellers do. This can easily be used to build a profile on you.

### Public Information

The majority of the information that you make public is also accessible to the website. While this should be assumed, many users don't realize that. For example, if you like a photo on Instagram, the service could identify elements in the photo (clothing, location, activity, etc.) and retain that information. Later you may see an advertisement for that element.

> By "public" I refer to anything on any public service. You should always assume that the big tech compaines sell personal messages, DMs, and email.

## Goodwill

Some users believe that services like Google Search, Email, and Twitter are free because the big tech companies want to do something good for the world. In reality, these services are how they became the big tech companies.

While many of the big tech companies are purely for-profit models, that is not always the case. One counter example is Wikipedia. It is one of the largest sources of free information on the internet. Wikipedia runs no ads and does not sell any personal information. Instead, they are funded by community donations. Its worth remembering that while you should always be skeptical of a free services, they are not all bad.
