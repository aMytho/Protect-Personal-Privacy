# I Have Nothing to Hide

This is a very common phrase by people who believe that protecting their privacy is not necessary. Criminals hide their data. I am not a criminal, therefore I will not hide my activities. This is a flawed argument and can potentially cause you harm.

## Protection

> Privacy isn't about something to hide. It's about something to protect. - Ed Snowden

A criminal does not care if you are a law abiding citizen or not. The hacker's goal is to steal your identity, sell your information, and generally ruin your life to benefit their own. The less info you give the hacker to work with, the harder it is to be affected. If you have ever been a victim of identity theft you can understand how difficult it can be to fix. Some cases can be fixed in a few phone calls and a matter of weeks, while others are irrecoverable. Even if the attack wasn't your fault (a trusted company breach), you do not have any control over the situation. Every app you use, company you trust, and online activity is a possible place of attack. If you protect your privacy, it is far more difficult for a hacker to succeed.

## Discrimination

Another reason to protect your privacy is discrimination. Your information reveals who you are as a person. Recently, many companies have been performing social media checks on potential employees. They read their public profile and posts and make a judgement. While some companies stop there, others go further and inspect activity from all corners of the internet.

In most environments, it is illegal to ask a potential employee about their religion, political opinion, or private habits. These "information checks" do not have any such restriction. Once we see a fact, we immediately have an opinion on it, whether we are allowed to or not. Protecting your digital life can help to prevent some of these issues.

## Laws

Laws are frequently changing. While you may be a law abiding citizen today, some of your activities may not be legal tomorrow. The U.S. government is extending its control over the digital world. We are starting to see this with the Tik-Tok ban. While Tik-Tok is terrible for privacy, so is every other U.S. based social media app! This app will likely be banned in the U.S. by next year.

Use of Tik-Tok should not be an illegal activity, but some users don't have a choice in the matter. My phone had Tik-Tok pre-installed, even though it was the last app I would want! My manufacturer prevents me from uninstalling it and several other apps. I don't want this app on my phone. I want to obey the law. However, unless I purchase a new phone, I cannot do so.

While this is really a problem with the lack of mobile device ownership, the point is that todays activities may not be legal tomorrow. Limit the services you use and have private alternatives ready.
