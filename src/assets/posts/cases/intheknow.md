# Awareness of New Privacy and Security Issues

Protecting your privacy and security is an ongoing task. There are several trusted resources which compile privacy and security issues. Keeping an eye on these resources will keep you informed of any potential threats.

## Security / Privacy Breaches

[Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/) uploads daily news of technology related problems. You can use them to be aware of any new vulnerabilities. While they also upload new about privacy issues, I've found other sources to be more helpful in preventing them, rather than just being aware of them.

[Tech Linked](https://www.youtube.com/@techlinked/videos) upload tri-weekly videos on the technology industry. They frequently include privacy and security issues as part of their content. As with Bleeping Computer, the primary purpose is to be informed, rather than fix all of the issues.

## Privacy Issues

[The Linux Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLinuxEXP) is a helpful channel for using free and open source software. They primarily focus on Linux software, but many of their services can be used on other platforms. They also highlight privacy issues in the industry and show viable alternatives to them.

[Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/@Techlore) has a large amount of tutorials for protecting your personal privacy and security. There are several that are of great benefit to users of this site:

[Rob Braxman](https://www.youtube.com/c/BraxMe) is a privacy advocate who created videos about many privacy issues. Many of his videos are very in-depth and show the privacy crisis of today.
