# Privacy Vs. Security

Privacy and security are frequently discussed together, but they are very different. Many services claim to be secure;their users assume that they are also private. However, this is usually not the case. Google is secure, but lacks any sort of privacy whatsoever!

## Security

Security referrs to protecting data or the account associated with the data. People usually focus on tools like 2FA (Two Factor Authentication), secure passwords, proper maintenance, etc. Adding increased security is nearly always at the cost of convienence. For example, adding 2FA protects your account, but requires you to carry your phone around. If you lose your phone, you lose your account! Proper application of security requires the user to decide what is the most important service to protect. Add the most protection to those services and use less security for the other services.

Security Checklist
- Add 2FA (Important Services)
- Strong password (All Services)
- Delete inactive accounts (All Services)

> Important services include things like banking, government accounts, payroll, and email. Note that the importance of services is a relative term. You may place a higher value on a social media service if you use it daily, while someone who never posts would not value it.

## Privacy

Privacy referrs to who has access to your data. Ideally, you are the sole accessor. However, this is rarely the case. Nearly every online service also has access to your information. Some services sell your information to other companies for various reasons. A truly private service only allows access from you and any authorized users (such as family in shared cloud storage). Advertisers, the employees of the service, and the government should not have access in any circumstance. Unfornatly, this rarely happens.

Privacy also includes the user and their metadata. The service should not report where you logged in, when you logged in, or what you did in your session. As shown above, this rarely happens.
