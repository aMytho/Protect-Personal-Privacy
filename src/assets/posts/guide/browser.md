# Browser

Your browser is used nearly every day and it collects an extremly large amount of information about you, and your browsing habits.

## Choosing a Browser

Your choice of browser is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself. To maintain support for most websites, you are limited to a fork of Chromium or Firefox.

What is Chromium?
> Chromium is the open source project that is in most browsers. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera GX, and many more browsers are based on it. While it is open source, Google controls the majority of it. Chromium is better for privacy than Google Chrome, but even it has its flaws. Still, if you want better privacy without any noticable changes, Chromium (or Ungoogled Chromium) is a valid alternative.

Firefox is a relatively private option. However, the base version of it does use some Google services. While some settings can be changed (such as the default search engine), others are more difficult to change (using the Google timeservers). Mozilla has accepted a large amount of money from Google to have these changes. Event with these changes, Firefox is a far better option than Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

### Chromium

One option is to use the Brave browser. This is a fork of Chromium with many enhancements for privacy. Brave has stripped out the Google tracking from the browser. Additionally, they have created their own search engine to replace Google. This was a huge undertaking and provides a valuable alternative.

Brave's real strength is its built in adblocker and privacy controls. It blocks nearly all ads and trackers. It offers varying levels of restriction to individual websites. You can easily whitelist or blacklist websites.

Additionally, Brave offers the option to view privacy *respecting* ads. These are completly optional but they help to support ongoing development. Brave will pay you with cryptocurrency if you turn this feature on.

### Firefox

Mainstream firefox will work for most users. However, if you want to remove the (few) Google features you can switch to Librewolf.

## Using Extensions

Regardless of the browser you pick, you will want extensions to protect your privacy. Most browsers (aside from Brave) simply show you the website without any filtering. Extensions allow us to pick and choose what content a website can load. This is commonly used for blocking ads but it can be used for much more. You can block cookies, cookie notices, specific elements on a page, and prevent scripts from loading. There are a few extensions that every user should have. 

### UBlock-Origin

This extension is the best one for controlling incoming content. It will block ads, trackers, and other annoying elements by default. You can manually "zap" elements to remove anything that may have bypassed the filter.

### Dencentraleyes

This extension prevents requests to non privacy respectign CDNs. Many common scripts or libraries are stored on a CDN (content delivery network). If you use a file from a CDN you can be identified. Based on the request, the CDN can figure out which website you are on. This extension intercepts the request and serves you the file from a different source.

### Cookie-Autodelete

This extension lets you control cookies. Cookies are used to store data on a user. This may be something helpful (such as rembering a color theme), or it may be used to identify a user for tracking purposes. Using Cookie-Autodelete you can delete all cookies when a site is closed or save a few for later. You may wish to keep one cookie and remove the rest.
