## Protecting Home Network

Protecting your home network is a relatively simple task. It provides increased security from local attacks and is mostly a one and done fix. While the settings vary, the general process is the same.

### Setup a Strong Password

This is a relatively simple task. A strong password ensures that nneighbors and passerby cannot use your network. It should be at least 8 characters with various symbols, numbers, and regular characters. Ideally, you should set it to be at least 15 characters since you only need to enter it when you join your network the first time.

You also need to setup wireless encryption. Choose one of the below methods. The first is the most secure, and the last is the least secure.

- WPA 3
- WPA 2
- WPA
- WEP

> Note that WPA 3 is a new standard and may not be supported.

### Device Filtering

This is a less common tactic, but is is very effective. You can setup MAC filtering to limit your network to only connect to certain devices. Like a password, this is a one time action that provides a lot of security. If a device is not on the list, it cannot connect.

### Keep Updated

Always download the latest router firmware. Your ISP may do this automatically.

### Firewall

You can setup a firewall to block certain incoming or outgoing communication. Unlike the other options, this is not a simple solution. You need to update the firewall to reflect your current needs.

Many routers support disabling ports and services. If you know you do not need a port, you can safley disable it. Here are a few common ports:

- ssh 22
- telnet 23

### Time Limit

Another method is to set a time limit during inactive hours. You can prevent devices from using your network when you don't need it. This can be used to prevent a hacker from using your device at night.

### Signal Strength

Your Wifi Network should only broadcast to locations where it will be accessed. An overly strong signal allows your neighborhood to access your network. Reducing the signal prevents this. The signal needs to be strong enough to go through your house but weak enough to be trapped inside.
